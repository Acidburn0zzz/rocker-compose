# NOTICE: Project Discontinued 

As of early 2018, the container ecosystem is much more mature than it was three years ago when this project was initiated. Now, most of the critical and outstanding features of rocker-compose can be easily covered by [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or other well-supported tools.

Even though rocker-compose is still used in production, we decided to discontinue its open source support as our team has different priorities now. We apologize to all active users for any inconvenience caused by the project shutdown. Also, sorry that some open issues have been left unanswered.

We hope that this project will serve an inspiration for other great initiatives in the community.

If you have anything critical, feel free to open an issue or email us.

See [original README.md](README.old.md).
